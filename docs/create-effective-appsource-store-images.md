# Create effective AppSource store images

Each AppSource listing contains images that are used to inform the user and promote the add-in. Store images provide users with a quick overview of features and enhance their understanding of the add-in’s value. To create the best images for your store listing, we recommend the following the guidelines.



## Make images legible

It is important that the content of each image is easy to read. Further it should reflect the quality of your solution. Users should be able to click through the store images and clearly view content and read captions at a glance.

|:----|:----|
|Use clear text and graphics with the [appropriate contrast ratios](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/accessibility/accessible-text-requirements#contrast-ratios).| Don’t show blurred, pixelated, or poorly rendered text or graphics.
|Provide at least one image that is 1366w x 768h pixels and no greater than 1024kb.  | Don't stretch or pinch your images (poor aspect ratio).
|Use magnified close-ups or crops when needed to make content legible.|Don’t make your content so small that it is illegible.|

## Avoid excess content
Use these images to focus the user’s attention on your solution. Images that contain extra unrelated content are distracting and confusing to the user.

|:----|:----|
|Use example personas when needed.|Don't show private or personal information.|
|Only show interface elements relevant to the add-in. Use the Office UI sparingly. |Don’t show unrelated user interface elements such as task bars, ribbons, or other applications.|
|Reinforce your brand by incorporating recognizable brand elements such as the logo or brand colors. | Don’t add unnecessary graphic elements that obstruct content. |

## Show the value of your add-in
The images should clearly communicate value of your solution and its main features. Focus each image on communicating one piece of information. Users will glance at each image very briefly. Demonstrate how your solution will be used. Show core value with clear illustrations.

|Use simple captions or call-outs to focus the user’s attention on one key feature.|Don’t communicate more than one point per image.|
|Only show content that helps illustrate how the add-in creates value for the user.| Don’t show large empty areas or unrelated content.|
|Position call-outs, magnifications or crops to focus customers on your solution.| Don’t use captions or call-outs that obstruct important content.|
